  - Proxy Re-Encryption (PRE) enables secure and controlled access with user consent.

- **Blockchain Integration**:
  - Immutable record-keeping for model updates through a blockchain-based Model Vault.
  - Transparent and secure consent management for data sharing.
  - Reward system using blockchain tokens to incentivize user participation and contributions.

- **Advanced Predictive Analytics**:
  - AI models personalized for individual cycle patterns.
  - Machine Learning algorithms for ovulation tracking and health insights.

- **User-Friendly Mobile Application**:
  - Intuitive Android interface designed with user-centric principles.
  - Real-time interaction, secure data handling, and predictive health insights.
