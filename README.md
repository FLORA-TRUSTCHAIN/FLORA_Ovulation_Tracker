# FLORA Project Repository

FLORA is a privacy-first ovulation tracking application designed to provide secure and accurate reproductive health insights. Leveraging cutting-edge technologies such as Federated Learning (FL), Blockchain, and advanced Privacy-Enhancing Technologies (PETs), FLORA ensures that sensitive personal data remains secure, empowering users with full control over their information.

## Features

- **Privacy-First Design**:
  - Federated Learning ensures data remains on users' devices.
  - Advanced cryptographic techniques such as Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) and Differential Privacy (DP) protect data throughout processing.
  - Proxy Re-Encryption (PRE) enables secure and controlled access with user consent.

- **Blockchain Integration**:
  - Immutable record-keeping for model updates through a blockchain-based Model Vault.
  - Transparent and secure consent management for data sharing.
  - Reward system using blockchain tokens to incentivize user participation and contributions.

- **Advanced Predictive Analytics**:
  - AI models personalized for individual cycle patterns.
  - Machine Learning algorithms for ovulation tracking and health insights.

- **User-Friendly Mobile Application**:
  - Intuitive Android interface designed with user-centric principles.
  - Real-time interaction, secure data handling, and predictive health insights.

## Technologies

- **Programming Languages & Frameworks**:
  - Kotlin for mobile app development.
  - Python libraries (PyTorch, NumPy, scikit-learn) for Federated Learning simulations.
  - Blockchain protocols (Ethereum smart contracts, IPFS).

- **Privacy-Enhancing Technologies**:
  - Fully Homomorphic Encryption using Microsoft's SEAL.
  - Differential Privacy libraries like OpenMined’s PyDP, IBM Diffprivlib, and PyTorch Opacus.

- **Blockchain Tools**:
  - Consent and token systems via ERC standards and ConInSe.
  - Off-chain storage for large data (IPFS, Swarm) with on-chain validation.

- **Cloud & APIs**:
  - REST APIs for seamless integration of components.
  - Dockerized services for consistent deployment environments.
