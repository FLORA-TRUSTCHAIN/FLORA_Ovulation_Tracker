## Known Issues
- [ ] Currently, we refresh the page when a training iteration is completed. This should be further investigated.
- [ ] When the page refreshes, we get some errors in the backend because the ws connection doesn't close properly

## TODO 
- [ ] Ensure that data.ts works as expected, e.g., if shuffling is working.
